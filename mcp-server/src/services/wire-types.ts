 * (here `"1"`) is the v1 negotiation rule. Producers SHOULD stamp records
 * with this constant rather than a free-form string so a major bump is
 * a single edit, not a search-and-replace.
 *
 * v1.1 (sub-phase 4a, merged in PR #101) adds the Proof-of-Knowledge
 * fields on `Lesson` (`evidence_root`, `evidence_count`,
 * `prev_lesson_hash`, `maturity_age_days`, `useful_count`). The bump is
 * additive — minor bumps are reserved for backward-compatible additions
 * per §1, so v1.0 records remain ingestable on v1.1 nodes.

// Wire interfaces — SWARM_SPEC §3

// Field types follow the spec table verbatim. TypeScript cannot enforce
// some of the constraints (e.g. `float[768]` exact length, `≤ 8 KiB`,
// multihash format) — those are runtime rejection rules in §5 and live
// in Phase 3b's validator. Consumers of these interfaces should treat
// them as the *shape* contract, not the *validity* contract.

/**
 * Lesson — generalized knowledge eligible for the wire (SWARM_SPEC §3.1).
 *
 * Producers MUST satisfy `synthesized_from_cluster_size >= 2` OR document
 * an abstracting synthesis step; on-wire, the cluster-size floor is what
 * the validator (Phase 3b, rule 11) enforces.
 *
 * v1.1 fields (Proof-of-Knowledge — SWARM_SPEC §3.7):
 *   - `evidence_root`     Merkle root over hashed experience IDs (multihash).
 *   - `evidence_count`    Number of underlying experiences (≥ 1).
 *   - `prev_lesson_hash`  Multihash of this node's previous lesson, or null
 *                         for the first lesson a node ever publishes.
 *   - `maturity_age_days` Whole days between local `created_at` and `signed_at`.
 *   - `useful_count`      How often this lesson was reinforced before signing.
 *
 * The five v1.1 fields are typed `?` (optional) here so a v1.0 record
 * — which omits them — still satisfies the interface. The validator
 * (sub-phase 4b runtime, future PR; rules 16–20 in SWARM_SPEC §5) is
 * the place that enforces "MUST be present when spec_version >= 1.1"
 * and "MUST be absent when spec_version == 1.0" (cross-version field
 * smuggling is rule 20).
